  Chainlink Node
  =============
  This Kurtosis package instantiates a Chainlink node environment with PostgreSQL databases for both the node and the transaction manager. It supports multiple node configurations and deployment types.

  Prerequisites
  -------------
  - Access to an EVM-compatible blockchain with RPC and WebSocket endpoints and chainid
  - Chainlink node operator credentials
  - API credentials for external data feeds (if using external adapters)

  Configuration
  -------------
  To configure this package, you'll need to provide the following information:
  - network:
    rpc: The RPC URL for the blockchain to connect to
    ws: The WebSocket URL for the blockchain to connect to
    chain_id: The chain ID of the blockchain network

  - chainlink_nodes: List of Chainlink nodes to deploy
    - node_name: Name of the Chainlink node
      image: "smartcontract/chainlink:latest"
      keystore_pw: "Password for the keystore"
      api_user: "API user"
      api_password: "API password"
      postgres: 
        user: "postgres"
        password: "Password for the PostgreSQL database"
        min_cpu: "Minimum CPU for the PostgreSQL database"
        max_cpu: "Maximum CPU for the PostgreSQL database"
        min_memory: "Minimum memory for the PostgreSQL database"
        max_memory: "Maximum memory for the PostgreSQL database"
    ... add more nodes as needed
